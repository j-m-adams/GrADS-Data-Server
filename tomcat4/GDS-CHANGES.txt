About the bundled Tomcat installation in GDS
============================================

This directory contains a modified version of the default Apache
Jakarta-Tomcat servlet container, version 4.1.

Tomcat is included with the GDS in order to make the installation
process simpler. The GDS does *not* require Tomcat specifically. The
GDS can run in any JSDK 2.3-compliant servlet container. See the GDS
administrator's guide (../doc/admin.html) for more details.

Changes made from the standard Tomcat installation:

conf/server.xml: 

	The HTTP 1.1 connector is on port 9090 instead of 8080.

	The shutdown port is 9005, and the shutdown string is
	"GDS-SHUTDOWN".

	All log messages go to ../log/tomcat.yyyymmdd.log

	A context named "doc" has been added, which points to the
	static GDS documentation pages in ../doc.

	The file server-gds.xml can be used to revert to the "factory"
	settings for use with GDS. The files server-noexamples.xml and
	server-examples.xml contain the "factory" settings from the
	Apache distribution.


webapps:
	
	All the default webapps, as well as the contents of
	server/webapps, have been removed from this distribution, to
	reduce the size of the package and avoid long filenames in the
	tarfile. The webapps directory contains only GDS-specific
	content.

	The default webapps can be obtained by downloading Tomcat 4.1 from
	http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat and copying the webapps and 
	server/webapps directories over.
