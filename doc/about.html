This eliminates the need for a client   to download large datasets to perform an operation that only generates a small   amount of data---instead, the operation is performed on the server, and the   small amount of generated data is transferred over the network. Analysis can   include previous analysis results and datasets uploaded by the user, as well   as datasets hosted on the server. </p><p class="item14" align="left">These services can be provided for any GrADS-readable   dataset. Making datasets available on the server is simply a matter of typing   in the location of the dataset in the configuration file. Datasets can be added   to and removed from the server listings on-the-fly, with no need to restart   the server, providing flexibility for data providers whose holdings change rapidly.</p><p class="item14" align="left">In addition, there are a number of parameters to   control the performance and resource usage of the server. The central component   is a Java servlet, which connects two pieces of pre-exising software: GrADS   (see below), which handles the actual data operations; and the OPeNDAP core, which   implements the protocol by which information is exchanged with the client across   the internet. The Jakarta Project's Tomcat package is used to provide an execution   environment for the servlet. All required software is free and open-source,   except the JVM implementation in some instances. </p><p class="item14" align="left">For more on GrADS, see the <a href="http://cola.gmu.edu/grads">GrADS   home page</a>.<br>  For more on Tomcat, see the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat   home page</a>. <br>  For more on servlets, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.html">Sun's   Java Servlet home page</a>.</p><p class="item14" align="left"><b>What is <span class="plaintext">OPeNDAP</span>?</b></p><p class="item14"><span class="plaintext">OPeNDAP (Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol) is a software framework that simplifies all aspects of data networking. OPeNDAP  provides tools   for making local data accessible to remote locations regardless of local storage   format. See the <a href="http://opendap.org/">OPeNDAP home   page</a> for more information. </span></p><p class="item14"><i><br>  </i></p><!-- #EndEditable --> </td>  </tr></table></body><!-- #EndTemplate --></html>
